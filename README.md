# ENSTvisualise
Tools for the Visualisation of Turbulence within an SPH simulation

Enstrophy can be numerically estimated from the SPH simulations and be used as a viable substitute solenoidal turbulence wihtin a galaxy cluster. 
This code uses numerical enstimations of enstrophy to visualise the turbulence within a Halo from the SURFS simulations.

This repository is largley dependant on code from the Simstar and Surfssuite repositories and packages found at: 
https://github.com/obreschkow/simstar & https://github.com/obreschkow/surfsuite.

Installation of ffmpeg is required for the compiling of the mp4 files to fully visualise the data. 
Before running funcitons define the global intiger value Global.nmax
